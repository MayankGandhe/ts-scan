# Adding Features

We highly apperaciate any kind of support in enhancing the capabilities further. On our current roadmap 

> [!IMPORTANT]

> PLEASE NOTE: To simplify integration of additional featurs, we have provided a short summary of how to add additional capabiliities in the following section as well as a few guidelines on how we want the code to be developed. See the [guidelines](/ts-scan/guidelines.md) for details. 

## 1. Decide where to add 

Before you start adding, decide on where you want to add featurs. Are you planning to add an additional **ecosystem**, e.g. PHP or C#? then you should add this to **ts-scan** itself. Are you instead planning to add something that will work on the **file**-level, then you amy prefer to add to **ts-deepscan**, the integrated file handler.

Please also have a look at the roadmap to get an idea on what is already planned, so that we do not waste resources in implementuing things twice.

Given, you made these decisions, you may start.

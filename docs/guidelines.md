# Development Guidelines

We higly appreciate any kind of support to extend the reach and capabilities of **ts-scan**. However, since it starts becoming a complex tool, we would be happy to see the following guidelines being respected when commiting code. It will simplify acceptance of commits and reduce effort for validation.

Feel free to reach out and discuss, if you are in doubt of any statement made here.

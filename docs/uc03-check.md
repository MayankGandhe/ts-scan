## Why you would want to do this?

â€‹	Benefits 

## Prerequisites

We suggest to use `pre-commit` to initiate the scan automatically. `pre-commit` is a Python based implementation that hooks in the git flow and allows to execute tests before a commit is completed. Only when the tests are successful, the commit is accepted. You may learn more about the tooling [here](https://pre-commit.com).

 

## Steps to Success

Scan a directory for dependencies first and store results into the ```scan.json``` file.

```shell
ts-scan scan -o scan.json <DIRECTORY>
```

Next, check the scan using TrustSource application: 

```shell
ts-scan check -o result.json scan.json
```

## Further Considerations

We highly recommend not to add execessive file based analysis to your `pre-commit` scans. Scanning for encryption, malware or licenses may take more time than a developer might want to wait for a pre-commit check.

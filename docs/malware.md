# Scanning for malware

**ts-scan** supports [yara](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) to scan for malware. We added it to simplify security checks of 3rd party elements.

Yara checks are *not* enabled by default. There are two options for the yara checks:

- Analysis of a directory content. Can be useful when only the source code from a directory has to be scanned

- Analysis of the dependencies files. In this case files of every dependency from a dependecy scan will be analysed as long as they are available.

## Rule sets

Yara is a great tool but it will only find, what you define in the rules. To learn more about yara rules, see [this site](https://). You may provide / define your own rule set or use ours, which is located in the subfolder '/yara-rules'. We are not yet able to update it frequently.
